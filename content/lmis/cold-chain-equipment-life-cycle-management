# Cold chain equipment life cycle management / Tracker program

## Introduction

This very simple Tracker program is very similar to the biomedical equipment lifecycle management solution but customized for cold chain equipment and considers the World Health Organization PQS (Program Quality Standards) appliance catalogue as well as the WHO PQS standard for Global asset identification.

In addition it offers a solution for creating and maintaining a dedicated catalogue of (selected) prequalified equipment which serves as a template for registering and enrolling new cold chain appliances. This allows "copying" the template of any specific prequalified appliance and adding device specific attributes such as the serial number or manufacturing date.

For purposes of demonstration a few specifications of a few refrigerators and freezers from the WHO PQS catalogue are configured but the same approach can be used for any other type of health care equipment.

## Use case

The cold chain equipment lifecycle management "Tracker program " allows establishing, updating and maintaining a complete catalogue of cold chain appliances with all their "generic" specifications commonly used in the country with .

Whenever a new piece of cold chain appliance is delivered to and installed at a healthcare facility, the respective "generic" appliance is selected from the national catalogue and "enrolled" in the "Cold chain equipment lifecycle management / Tracker program" of the respective "Organisation Unit". The "enrolment" is completed with device specific attributes such as the manufacturing date, GTIN and serial number which can be "copied" directly from the scanned GS1 DataMatrix code attached to the appliance.

For healthcare facilities where cold chain appliance are not yet furnished with GS1 DataMatrix codes, alternatively a unique identifier can be assigned to every appliance.

## DHIS2 configuration

This application is configured as a "Tracker program" which uses only simple, native DHIS2 functionality. The number, description and contents of each of the stages can be very easily customized to national needs without any programming knowledge.

### Organisation unit

## Workflow for registering new appliances

While details on all DHIS2 workflows are available in the general DHIS2 documentation and although the "cloning" of appliances uses only native DHIS2 functionality, it is an "edge case", a very specific use of the "Relationship" function and therefore the steps are explained below:

The workflow below explains the workflow for the following example:

A new icelined refrigerator (E003/007) has been delivered to the health facility (OU) "0001 CH Mahosot". The user "registers" and "enrols" this new appliance using the default specifications from the catalogue of PQS pre-qualified appliances in the "World Health Organization PQS catalogue". These "generic" appliance specifications are then "copied" for creating a new appliance at the "0001 CH Mahosot" before adding the appliance specific attributes such as the serial number or the manufacturing date. User:

- opens the DHIS2 Capture Android app on a mobile device and authenticates: the DHIS2 home screen opens showing all Programs and Data sets

- select "Cold chain equipment lifecycle management": a list of all registered and enrolled appliances is displayed

- selects "World Health Organization PQS catalogue" from the "ORG. UNIT" filter: a catalogue with all of the PQS pre-qualified appliances appears

- searches for and selects the cold chain appliance which is being installed: a single appliance is listed

- taps on the cold chain appliance: the TEI dashboard of the Tracker Program for this particular appliance is displayed

- taps on the "Relationship" icon at the bottom in the middle: a separate dialogue window opens

- taps on the "+" icon: a list of available "Relationships" appears
- selects "World Health Organization PQS catalogue" from the list of "Relationships": a separate dialogue window opens

- taps in the header "All Cold chain appliance": a drop-down dialogue window opens

- selects "Cold chain appliance lifecycle management": a list of appliances appears

_Note: this screen may look like "back to square one" (as it looks like the home screen) but is a necessary step in the whole process_

- selects the "+ Create new" icon at the right bottom of the screen: the OU dialogue window opens

- selects the "Organisation unit" where the appliance is being installed by checking the box (in our example "0001 CH Mahosot")

- selects the "Done" icon: the calendar dialogue window opens: by default the current date is pre-selected

- selects the installation data of the appliance from the calendar
- selects the "ACCEPT" icon: the dialogue window of the "cloned" (newly "registered" and "enrolled" device) with the selected "Enrolloing OU" and "Enrollment date" is displayed

- expands the lower section "2 Cold chain appliance lifecycle management" by tapping on the caret down (inverted caret) symbol ( ): the list of specifications (Tracked Entity Attributes) is displayed
![](media/image3.png)

- scans the GS1 DataMatrix code on the appliance which "populates" the GTIN, serialized number and production date fields automatically (if no GS1 DataMatrix code is available, those details are entered manually)

- completes the "Place of installation"
- selects the pin icon to record the geolocation (longitude/latitude) of the place of installation

- selects the blue "Save" icon at the bottom right: the dialogue window displaying all available "Relationships" is displayed

- selects the red trash icon displayed next to the "Relationship" entry: "There are no relationships, click + to add a new one" appears

_Note that once the new appliance has been "cloned" in the health facility where the appliance is installed, there is no need to maintain any "Relationship" with "World Health Organization PQS catalogue" catalogue item._

- selects the back arrow: the "cloned" appliance appears on the Tracker Program home screen

- taps on the grey synchronization icon appearing next to the "cloned" appliance: the "Sync needed" dialogue window opens

- taps on the "Send" icon: the new appliance is synchronized with the central server (provided a network connection is available)

- continues work or closes the Capture Android app.

Note that this workflow is currently only available in Capture Android app as the DHIS2 web app does not (yet) allow changing the Organisation Unit (OU) when creating a new Tracked Entity Instance (TEI) but this enhancement is planned for future DHIS2 versions.
