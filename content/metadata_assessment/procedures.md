# Procedures

While this guide discusses several key technical considerations and tools that can be used to review metadata configuration, there can often be a number of procedural issues that can result in these metadata challenges. By reviewing them and outlining measures to mitigate these challenges going forward; they can hopefully be avoided after a system has been reviewed and cleaned. Some of the procedural issues that result in components of a configuration deteriorating over time include:

- Lack of procedures for adding metadata
- Lack of coordination when adding new metadata
- Incorrect assumptions when adding WHO digital data packages
- Revisions of data collection forms over time
- New objects being added to a production server that do not serve any real purpose. These items are subsequently not cleaned up properly.
