# Implementation guide
This section of the documentations is intended for people involved in the implementation of DHIS2. This includes both people involved planning and managing implementations, and those involved in the technical work.

**DHIS2 implementation** gives an overview of DHIS2 implementations in general, including topics such as:
	
- guidance on how to plan and budget DHIS2 implementations
- an overview of key design principles for DHIS2
- DHIS2 as a digital platform
- integration and interoperability with other systems

This section thus aims at give the reader an idea of key considerations for the implementation of DHIS2, without going into any technical detail.

**Tracker implementation** goes into further detail on the additional issues that needs to be considered for the implementation of the case-/event-based functionality of DHIS2.

**Android implementation** is similarly focused on the specific implementation issues for the DHIS2 Android (mobile) application.

**Database design** provides guidance on the design of the DHIS2 database, i.e. data collection and analysis functionality. It discusses general database design issues, as well as going into depth on the issues that are specific for setting up the aggregate functionality of DHIS2.

The **Maintenance and use** section considers topics related to maintenance and use of DHIS2, such recommendations on managing user and user roles and localisation of DHIS2 into different languages.

**Support and documentation** gives an overview of the different channels through which support to DHIS2 implementations is available, and how implementers can contribute to the DHIS2 documentation.

**Software release information** provides an overview of changes includes in each DHIS2 and DHIS2 Android release, along with upgrade notes that provides important information related to the upgrades.
